(ns hooks.hyper.lint
  "Shared lint helpers for the hyper render-region hooks.

   `check-render-effects!` scans a render body (the body of `reactive` /
   `async`) for effects that break render purity — framework effects
   (`watch!`, `spawn!`) and state mutations (`swap!`/`reset!` and the `-vals!`
   variants) — and registers a warning for each.

   It descends through ordinary render forms (hiccup vectors, `let`/`when`/`for`,
   …) but PRUNES sub-forms that are not render flow:

   - `action` / `expr` — event and client-side contexts, where mutating a
     cursor or signal is exactly the point;
   - nested `reactive` / `async` / `defc` — they carry their own analysis.

   Matching is by symbol name, so both `h/watch!` and a referred `watch!` are
   caught, and `compare-and-set!` (the cursor/signal default-init, declarative)
   is intentionally absent from the mutation set."
