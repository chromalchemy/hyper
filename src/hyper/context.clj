;; Render purity guard
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Under the form-1/2/3 ladder, a render fn is a pure function of state:
;; effects (cursor mutation, watch!, async workers) belong in form-2 setup
;; or a form-3 :mount, NEVER in the render phase.  This guard makes that
;; boundary observable — it warns (or, when configured, throws) when an
;; effect runs while a render is in progress.
;;
;; *render-guard* is nil outside of rendering (actions, setup closures,
;; form-3 mount/unmount, background workers) so effects there are silent.
;; During a render it is bound to a guard atom:
;;
;;   {:mode   :deferred | :active   ;; see below
;;    :level  :warn | :error | :off ;; what an offending effect does
;;    :events [ {:kind .. :detail ..} ... ]}
;;
;; The page handler is called once with mode :deferred because we cannot yet
;; tell form-1 (pure body — effects should warn) from a form-2 setup closure
;; (effects are legal) until we see the return value.  Offending effects are
;; buffered into :events during this phase.  Once the form is known the
;; dispatcher either discards the buffer (form-2/3 — setup was legal) via
;; `guard-discard!`, or flushes it as warnings (form-1) via
;; `guard-flush-and-activate!`.  Both transition the mode to :active, under
;; which any further effect (the render body, lazy hiccup realization, a
;; form-2/3 render fn) is judged immediately.
;;
;; (*render-guard* and make-guard are defined earlier in this file so the
