  "Unified per-tab sub-region lifecycle registry.

   A *subview* is a managed region of a page that owns a slice of lifecycle:
   it subscribes to a set of Watchable `:deps`, optionally renders (the
   reactive case), and is swept when it disappears from the view tree.  This
   is the single mechanism the higher-level subsystems route through:

   - `hyper.reactive` (a render-bearing subview, `:on-change :partial`) —
     re-renders only itself when its deps change.
   - (future) `h/watch!` (a deps-only subview, `:on-change :full`) and
     `h/async` (a `:mount`/`:unmount`-bearing subview) plug into the same
     registry.

   State layout (per tab):
     [:tabs id :subviews        sid] -> the subview spec (see register-subview!)
     [:tabs id :subview-watches sid] -> {watch-key dep} bookkeeping for teardown

   Deps are reference-counted via `hyper.watch` so a source shared across
   subviews/tabs is only disposed when the last consumer releases it.  A
   subview's `:on-change` decides what a dep change triggers: `:partial`
   re-renders just this subview (a targeted Datastar fragment), `:full`
   triggers a full page re-render."

   the component id for targeted partial fragments, caches the HTML, and
   registers a render-scoped, partial-on-change subview whose deps are
   `[cell & user-deps]`:

   - a write to `cell` (the worker finishing) re-renders only this region;
   - a change to a user dep re-runs the body, whose coordination step detects
     the change and refetches (stale-while-revalidate).

   `:unmount` (run when the region is swept — it disappeared from the view
   tree — or on disconnect) interrupts any in-flight fetch and drops the
   coordination store.  The render body must return a single rooted hiccup
   element (as with `reactive`), so the id can be injected.  Returns the
