  "Render queue — single coordination primitive for the per-tab renderer.

   Replaces the previous atoms (pending-partials*, full-render-needed*,
   pending-scripts*) and Semaphore with a single LinkedBlockingQueue.

   Writers (HTTP handler threads, reactive watch callbacks) enqueue typed
   events; the renderer fiber drains them in batches via `drain!`, which
   blocks until at least one event is available and then atomically drains
   all pending events into a categorized map.

   This eliminates all shared mutable state between producer and consumer
   threads — the queue IS the coordination primitive."
