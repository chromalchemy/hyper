  "Internal-state reactivity for hyper tabs.

   Two responsibilities live here:

   - The **app-state watcher** (`setup-watchers!`): a single watch on
     `app-state*` that triggers a re-render when this tab's global / session /
     tab / route / signal state changes.  This is the cursor & signal
     reactivity primitive.

   - **Source reference counting** (`retain-source!` / `release-source!`):
     shared by `hyper.subview`, which now owns ALL external-source watching
     (reactive regions, user `h/watch!`, route-level `:watches`, and the
     framework routes/head Var + component-registry watches).  When the last
     consumer releases a source its `-dispose` is called."
