  "Multipart file uploads for hyper actions.

   An upload is just an `h/action` whose body uses a file client param ($form
   or $files) — the macro then routes the request through a multipart/form-data
   transport instead of Datastar's JSON @post().  Files cannot ride the JSON
   channel, so this is a real `fetch`/XHR multipart POST to `/hyper/upload`,
   parsed server-side by Ring's multipart middleware (streaming each part to a
   temp file on disk).

   Status + progress flow through an `:upload` ref the caller supplies — any
   IRef, but a `signal` is recommended:

     (let [status* (h/signal :avatar-upload {:phase :idle :percent 0})]
       [:form {:data-on:submit__prevent (h/action {:upload status*} (save! $form))}
        ...]
       [:progress {:data-attr:value (h/expr (:percent @status*))}])

   The ref's value is a map:

     {:phase   :idle | :uploading | :processing | :done | :error
      :percent 0-100        ;; live transfer % (signal refs only)
      :result  <handler return value, on :done>
      :error   <message string, on :error>}

   Who writes what:
   - A signal ref gets live client-side writes during transfer
     (phase :uploading + percent) plus server writes on receipt; the server's
     status changes are pushed back over SSE (the server never writes :percent
     mid-transfer, so it can't clobber the client's live value — it sets
     percent 100 only once the body has fully arrived).
   - A cursor/atom ref is server-only: no live transfer %, just
     :idle -> :processing -> :done/:error via the normal re-render.

   The handler's return value becomes :result; an uncaught throw becomes
   :error.  Because the ref is the caller's, the handler may also write it
   directly for richer (e.g. per-file) status."
