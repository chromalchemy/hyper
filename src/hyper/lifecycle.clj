(ns hyper.lifecycle
  "View lifecycle vocabulary shared across page handlers (and, later,
   reactive sub-regions and async workers).

   Hyper page handlers climb a Reagent-style form ladder, chosen by the
   ownership question \"what does this view own?\":

   - **form-1** — owns nothing.  A pure `(fn [req] -> hiccup)`.  This is the
     default and needs nothing from this namespace.

   - **form-2** — owns only framework-managed subscriptions (auto-cleaned).
     The handler returns a *setup* closure that runs once per mount and
     returns the pure render fn:

       (fn [req]                 ;; setup — runs once, effects allowed
         (h/watch! some-source)
         (let [data* (h/tab-cursor :data)]
           (fn [req]             ;; render — runs every render, must be pure
             [:div @data*])))

   - **form-3** — owns an external resource that needs explicit teardown.
     The handler returns a `View` (via `view`) whose `:mount` allocates the
     resource and *returns* it; the framework threads that value into
     `:render` and `:unmount`:

       (h/view
         {:mount   (fn []         (open-conn! ...))
          :render  (fn [conn req] [:div (query conn)])
          :unmount (fn [conn]     (close! conn))})

   There is deliberately no per-view mutable `ctx` slot: the server is
   always in declarative-rerender mode, so a resource opened at mount,
   read during renders, and closed at unmount is simply a value threaded
   immutably through the lifecycle."

  "Construct a form-3 `View` from a map.

   Keys:
   - :render  (required) `(fn [resource req] -> hiccup)`.  `resource` is the
              value returned by `:mount` (nil when there is no `:mount`).
   - :mount   (optional) `(fn [] -> resource)`.  Runs once when the view
              mounts.  Its return value is the resource threaded into
              `:render` and `:unmount`.
   - :unmount (optional) `(fn [resource] -> any)`.  Runs once when the view
              unmounts (route change, re-mount, or tab disconnect).

   A `View` is a distinct record type — not a bare map — so page dispatch
   can tell it apart unambiguously from a hiccup vector, a form-2 render
   fn, or a Ring response map."
